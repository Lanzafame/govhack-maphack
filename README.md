# Motivation
In 2015, a young group of coders have chosen to build NavLights - an application to help young drivers, learners, parents and instructors learn where the most statistically safe roads are for learning, find different driving conditions and be cautions in less forgiving roads. 

By using the data presented by data.qld.gov.au the project finds the exact location of road crash locations along with their fatality, and presents a heat map for easy viewing for learner drives to find where to take their next practice drive.
